# Guidelines for audio recording

Below are a series of guidelines for recording audio, developed during the process of creating [freely-licensed audio versions](https://github.com/global-asp/gasp-audio) of multilingual stories from the [African Storybook](http://africanstorybook.org/) and [Global African Storybook Project](https://global-asp.github.io) collections.

The guidelines are divided into sections for [readers](#for-readers) and [producers](#for-producers), with suggestions for those recording in a studio, as well as those who do not have access to a studio or audio engineer. They are being updated as we go through the process of recording additional audio for several dozen more languages.

## Guidelines

Keep in mind that these are guidelines for recording with minimal (and inexpensive) audio equipment, and specifically without access to high-end peripherals, audio engineers, or audio processing tools, and often in the field rather than in a studio. The idea is to maximize quality while minimizing processing time under such conditions.
