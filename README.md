# Guidelines for audio recording

Below are a series of guidelines for recording audio, developed during the process of creating [freely-licensed audio versions](https://github.com/global-asp/gasp-audio) of multilingual stories from the [African Storybook](http://africanstorybook.org/) and [Global African Storybook Project](https://global-asp.github.io) collections.

The guidelines are divided into sections for [readers](#for-readers) and [producers](#for-producers). They are being updated as we go through the process of recording additional audio for a dozen or more languages.

## Guidelines

Keep in mind that these are guidelines for recording with minimal (and inexpensive) audio equipment, and specifically without access to high-end peripherals, audio engineers, or audio processing tools, and often in the field rather than in a studio. The idea is to maximize quality while minimizing processing time under such conditions.

### For producers

* Reading at length can be dry and thirsty work -- try to provide ample water for readers before and after the recording session
* Provide the stories to readers in advance of the recording day, to allow them time to read through them and prepare
  * Ask them to note any words they are unsure of (pronunciation, names, etc), as well as errors in the text, so that they can be addressed and corrected before recording
* Prepare a text file, PDF, or printout containing the text of all stories in sequence
  * If you are providing an electronic version of the script for the recording session, it might also be a good idea to prepare a mouse with a middle scroll button, or a trackpad or other device that can be scrolled silently during the recording with breaking flow or losing position
* Test the microphone in advance, and then again after being adjusted for the reader
  * Specifically ask readers to read out loud a short sentence or two containing a variety of [sibilants](https://www.videomaker.com/article/c4/14106-plosives-and-sibilance) or [plosives](http://transom.org/2016/p-pops-plosives/) (e.g. /s/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/, /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/ etc), such as the following:
    * "She sells sea-shells on the sea-shore..."
    * "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers..."
  * If this produces unwanted hissing or popping noises on playback, then adjust the microphone placement or experiment with one of the many ways of making a [DIY pop filter](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Pop-Filter) to reduce the noise
* Try to eliminate sources of ambient noise (fans, vents, machinery etc) or find a quiet location or studio space to record if possible
  * Be particularly aware of traffic noise which may occur at irregular intervals and be heard through windows etc even if they are closed.

### For readers

* Don't rush -- read in a normal voice, at moderate speed
* Don't try to dramatize or "act out" the story by reading in an exaggerated voice
* Leave a slight pause between pages (1 or 2 seconds max.)
* Leave a longer pause between stories (3 or 4 seconds max.)
* Keep pronunciation natural, but as accurate as possible
* If there is any unfamiliar vocabulary in the text, try to practice it in advance
* Don't position the microphone directly in front of your mouth
* If you find you are running out of breath, slow down (or take a brief pause from reading); you are probably rushing too quickly through the stories
* If you make a mistake, **don't panic**: pause for a second or two and repeat the entire sentence again (the error will be removed in post-processing)
